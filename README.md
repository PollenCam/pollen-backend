# README

Why hello there, README. I didn't see you there the past...few months.

Anyway, I should probably document stuff here.

# Environment Variables

## Production

- `DEVISE_SECRET_KEY` - set this with `$ bundle exec rake secret`

## Development

- `SPEC_NOTIFICATIONS` - this should be `true` if you're using macOS and you want audio / visual notifications for your test results
